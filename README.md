# Deep-Learning

Problem Statement:
The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
Using the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm trained the model on the training data set and then applying the same model 
on test data to identify the digits in the images as close as possible.

Achieved 99.3% accuracy
